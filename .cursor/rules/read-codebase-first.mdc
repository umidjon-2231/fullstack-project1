# Read CODEBASE.md First

Before executing **any** task in this project, read `CODEBASE.md` at the workspace root.

It documents:
- Project overview and what every section does
- Angular 21 patterns in use (standalone components, Signals, `output()`, `viewChild()`, `inject()`, `@for`/`@if`)
- Design system — CSS variables, fonts, shared classes (`.section-title`, `.reveal`, etc.)
- Component catalog with responsibilities and key implementation details
- Naming conventions for files, classes, selectors, signals, outputs
- Step-by-step guides for adding new sections, icons, state, timers, and pages
- Special features: scroll-reveal wiring, Konami code, confetti flow, easter eggs

Skipping this file risks violating established patterns.
